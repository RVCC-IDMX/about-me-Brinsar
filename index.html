                <p>Some people might not realize that CSS can be used to animate as well and it is fairly simple. With CSS there is an animation property you can make simple animated projects that let you control the duration as well as the animation sequence itself. To define the animation sequence you can use keyframe commands that tell CSS what order you need to have the frames animated. To make a CSS animation, you need three things an HTML element to animate, a CSS rule which binds the animation to this element, and a group of keyframes that defines the styles at the start and end of the animation.</p>


                <p>The advantages of animations in webpages make it look more professional and flashy. You can make text scroll or have images move across the screen. Some good examples of cool animations used in CSS would be on the W3 school's website which shows students examples of really neat CSS animations as well as a brief tutorial on how to add simple things to your own webpage. The history of animation in CSS started in the early 2000s with only the hover command which allowed very rudimentary animations, especially for today's standards. In 2009 there were more features added to CSS that allowed the more complex movement to happen. Flash was still the superior and more popular version of animation all the way until it died out in 2020.</p>


                <p>Flash let users work cross platform unlike the rest of animation software in those days, unfortunately, it was a closed source program. To animate without flash people began using vector graphics or SVG files and gifs. SVG files work similarly to how CSS works with commands embedded in the file. CSS tran­si­tions which were introduced at this time allow you to write quick ani­ma­tions that run in response to a trig­ger while CSS ani­ma­tions give you more pow­er­ful con­trol over the pro­gres­sion of an ani­ma­tion as well as how it executes.</p>


                <p>The difference between CSS and javascript is that CSS is a great place to define all the ani­ma­tions but it’s not the place to con­trol ani­ma­tions. JavaScript on the oth­er hand isn’t a great place to define the ani­ma­tions but it is a great place to con­trol them, so there is a give and take between each of them, there is no perfect one it is more of a "pick the right tool for the right job".</p>


                <p>Another difference between the two would be that javascript told the browser how to do things with the animation while, while CSS told the browser what to do with the animation. HTML5 has improved web animation especially in CSS, but the king of animation today is Javascript. By design CSS is supposed to be easier to use, to be able to be used in entry level animation as well as introducing a function called ease-in-out which animators use if they are feeling lazy and don't want to code as much. CSS also can interact with WAAPI as CSS and other programs shouldn't be seen as enemies, but just as different tools.</p>
