## Introduction 
Hello! I am currently in the Webpage Development course. This is my final project for the course. This project was meant to demonstrate how to effectively create and style a webpage. This webpage includes a picture gallery, online form, index with working links, and video. Skills I have learned in this project would be how to effectivly style a webpage for the visualy impared as well as making it pleasing to the eye with contrasting colors. For the logo U+I used Overlock Black to type my initials with a blue and purple color to compemet each other. As well as making it formatted well with other devices such as phones or tablets. I learned how to push my code from vs code to my github account remotely and how to view a live preview of the webpages code as well as the power of copyright law and just how restricted some things online can be for good reason. 

## Description
A brief description of my project shows the colors I used to format the webpage which would be #c1d1e2, #6B80E3, #E3BD49, and white. Fonts that I chose are Abel and Gemunu Libre. I chose to make the contact form border to have a curved line instead of a box to add some spice to the website. I didn't want every box to be the same.
