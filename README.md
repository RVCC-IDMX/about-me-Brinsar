## Introduction 
Hello! I am currently in the Webpage Development course and this is my final project for the class. This project was meant to demonstrate how to effectively and neatly create and style a webpage. This webpage includes a picture gallery, online form, index with working links, and video. Skills I have learned in this project would be how to effectively style a webpage for the visually impaired as well as making it pleasing to the eye with contrasting colors. For the logo, I used Overlock Black to type my initials with a blue and purple color to complement each other. The webpage has been formatted to fit well in mobile devices such as iPhones, tablets and normal desktops. I added a hamburger icon to neatly display all the options for my index instead of having them hang at the top. As well as making it formatted well with other devices such as phones or tablets. I learned how to push my code from vs code to my Github account remotely and how to view a live preview of the webpage's code as well as the power of copyright law and just how restricted some things online can be for good reason. 

## Description
A brief description of my project shows the colors I used to format the webpage which would be #c1d1e2, #6B80E3, #E3BD49, and white. Fonts that I chose are Abel and Gemunu Libre. I chose to make the contact form border to have a curved line instead of a box to add some spice to the website. I didn't want every box to be the same.
